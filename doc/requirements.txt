# sphinx version 1.7.1 seems to have introduced an API change.
# ReadtheDocs gave the following error
#
# sphinx-build: error: argument -d/--maxdepth: invalid int value: '_build/doctrees-readthedocs'
#
# We pin sphinx to 1.7.0 and will need to revisit this from time to time.
# The error is caused by manually calling sphinx-apidoc in conf.py
#
# UPDATE: With 1.7.9 this seems to no longer be an issue (didn't try for earlier versions).
# On the contrary, 1.7.0 together with Python 3.7 produces another issue resulting from importing
# ExtraVisdom -> "TypeError: __mro_entries__ must return a tuple". Commenting out the sphinx
# requirement, but leaving this here for now.
#
# sphinx==1.7.0
